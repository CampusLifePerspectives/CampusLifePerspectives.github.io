# About the project
The Campus Life Perspectives project is an experiment of doing data driven architectural evaluation of DTU Campus, Lyngby. The aim is to gain insight into how students experience the physical surroundings from three different perspectives: _Social Life_, _Study Activities_, _Motivation & Inspiration_.
Front and center to the project is the Urban Belonging app, which allows you to share photos of your favorite locations on campus and to react to those of others.

The ambition is that your insights can help inform the ongoing renewal of campus. Read more about how [here!](https://campuslifeperspectives.github.io/About-the-Project/)
The data collection will run the duration of September and will be made available to all interested parties after the fact.


## The themes

### Social Life
With this theme, we take interest in where you go to be social, connect or just hang out on campus, outside of formal study activities. 

#### _What is a good meeting spot?_
#### _What is a good place to hang out?_
#### _Where do you often run into people you know?_

### Study Activities
This theme is about the places around Lyngby Campus (inside or outside) you find is good for studying.

#### _What is a good place to study?_
#### _Where do you feel most productive?_
#### _Where do you like to do group work?_
#### _What is your favorite lecture hall?_	

### Motivation and inspiration
This theme is about what parts of campus elicit feelings of inspiration or motivation. This could be because of one of the many laboratories around campus or any other reasons you feel inspired.

#### _Where do you feel inspired and/or motivated?_
#### _Where is research most visible to you?_

# How does the app work?
When you open one of the Photo Tasks, you have the three following options
- Take a Picture
- Go for a Walk
- Start a Reaction Round

### *Important* For the app to work properly, you have to give permission to see your location at all times!

## Take a Picture
Once you have taken a picture of something you want to share, you are asked to do two things: Rate the picture in terms of your sentiment to the place (“Is this for me?”), and assign tags to the picture, according to what made you take it. If you don’t find a tag on the list that fits your picture, feel free to add your own, using the “other” button.

</p>

## Go for a walk
With this option, the app tracks your positioning for the duration of your “walk”, until you close the app again or submit your walk. With this option you can still take pictures along the way, but you can use it if you want to put special emphasis on a route you normally take - or even one you want to avoid!

</p>

## Start a Reaction Round
This function allows you to react to 20 random pictures that other users have taken. Just as if you took it self, you can give your sentiment on the picture (“is this for me?”) and assign any tags you feel fit the picture. This function is our primary way of knowing if users feel the same way about places around campus, so feel free to react as much as you want - even if you sometimes see pictures from places you haven’t been to.
