# <span style="color:#a42424;font-weight:bold;font-size:150%"> Campus Life Perspectives</span>

The Campus Life Perspectives project is an experiment of doing data driven architectural evaluation of DTU Campus, Lyngby. The aim is to gain insight into how students experience the physical surroundings from three different perspectives: _Social Life_, _Study Activities_, _Motivation & Inspiration_.
Front and center to the project is the Urban Belonging app, which allows you to share photos of your favorite locations on campus and to react to those of others.

The ambition is that your insights can help inform the ongoing renewal of campus. Read more about how [here!](https://campuslifeperspectives.github.io/About-the-Project/)

The data collection will run the duration of September and will be made available to all interested parties after the fact.

# The Themes

### Social Life
With this theme, we take interest in where you go to be social, connect or just hang out on campus, outside of formal study activities. 

- _What is a good meeting spot?_
- _What is a good place to hang out?_
- _Where do you often run into people you know?_

### Study Activities
This theme is about the places around Lyngby Campus (inside or outside) you find is good for studying.

- _What is a good place to study?_
- _Where do you feel most productive?_
- _Where do you like to do group work?_
- _What is your favorite lecture hall?_    

### Motivation & Inspiration
This theme is about what parts of campus elicit feelings of inspiration or motivation. This could be because of one of the many laboratories around campus or any other reasons you feel inspired.

- _Where do you feel inspired and/or motivated?_
- _Where is research most visible to you?_
