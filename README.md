In collaboration with DTU Campus Service, Polyteknisk Forening and [ERIK Architects](https://www.erik.dk/) – lead building consultant at DTU – we invite you to participate in our thesis project, and help shape the future of Lyngby Campus. Read more about how [here!](https://campuslifeperspectives.github.io/About-the-Project/)
# What we need you to do

# How do I sign up?
The only thing you need to participate, is the Urban Belonging App.
- [Get the App for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbanbelonging.app)
- [Get the App for IOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/urban-belonging/id1573456017)


Once you have downloaded the app, create a new user using your DTU email.

</p>

Once signed up you will be added to the three thematic Groups. New users will be added to groups at 2 PM each day. If you have any problems signing up or if you haven’t been added to the group yet, feel free to write us at <campuslifeperspectives@gmail.com>

## What do I do in the app?
In the three groups or under “Photo Tasks”, you will see a list of prompts. Don’t worry, you don’t need to answer all of them. Instead, if a prompt brings a specific place to mind — go there and take a picture of it!
